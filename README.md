Operational Transformation for Multimedia

# TODO
1. paramatrisation (url) of the server => multiple drawings
2. investigate undo-redo after recent modifications

# Ideas
- add sound & video
- subdivide/merge objects to rework them <= AWESOME but need ~10h
- handle non-trivial conflicts => overlapping 3D (need previous)

# Current state (main points)
- type of data supported : path and raster
- operation supported : draw, move, delete
- undo-redo
- import & export images
- resistante to latency (even work offline)
